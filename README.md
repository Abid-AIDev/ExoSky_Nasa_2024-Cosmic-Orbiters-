ExoSky: Explore the Universe in 3D

ExoSky is a research-driven application designed to visualize exoplanets and celestial data using the Gaia dataset. It provides a dynamic 3D star map and offers a local AI assistant called Aurora, which aids in research and data analysis. This project was developed as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 by the Cosmic Orbiters team.

Key Features

	•	3D Star Map: Visualize stars and exoplanets in a rich 3D environment, sourced directly from the Gaia dataset.
	•	Local AI Assistant - Aurora: This AI assists with research tasks, generating intelligent insights and sample graphs from the dataset.
	•	Sample Graphs: The app generates graphs and visualizations to help users understand and interpret astronomical data.
	•	Customization: Users can color stars by name or brightness and adjust the visual representation of the map.
	•	Interactive Interface: Navigate the star map and interact with data in real time.

Applications

	•	Astronomy Research: A tool for astronomers to visualize and analyze celestial data.
	•	Educational Resource: Perfect for students or enthusiasts learning about exoplanets and stars.
	•	Data Analysis: Helps make sense of complex datasets using graphical representations.
	•	Public Outreach: A visually engaging tool to connect the public with space exploration and research.

AI Features

To use the AI assistant Aurora, Llama3.1 must be installed. Follow the installation guide from the Llama3.1 documentation to integrate AI features correctly into your system.

Requirements

To run the ExoSky project successfully, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Main Requirements

	1.	Python 3.10+
	2.	customtkinter (for the GUI interface)
	3.	matplotlib (for graph generation)
	4.	numpy (for handling data arrays)
	5.	pandas (for data manipulation and reading CSV files)
	6.	Gaia Dataset (publicly available for star and exoplanet data)
	7.	Llama3.1 (for AI-driven research assistance and insight generation)

Installation Steps

	1.	Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/Abid-AIDev/ExoSky_Nasa_2024-Cosmic-Orbiters-


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd ExoSky_Nasa_2024-Cosmic-Orbiters-


	3.	Install the necessary Python dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
