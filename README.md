# ExoSky Project

## Overview

ExoSky is a research-oriented application designed for astronomers and enthusiasts to explore exoplanets and celestial data. Utilizing the Gaia dataset, ExoSky presents a 3D star map that enhances the understanding of our universe. The application features a local AI assistant named **Aurora**, which supports research and computation by providing insights and sample graphs.

## Key Features

- **3D Star Map:** Visualize stars and exoplanets in a dynamic 3D environment sourced from the Gaia dataset.
- **Local AI Assistant (Aurora):** Assists users with research tasks and computations, delivering intelligent insights and suggestions.
- **Sample Graphs:** Provides graphical representations of data from the Gaia dataset, enhancing comprehension of astronomical phenomena.
- **Customization Options:** Tailor the 3D star map's appearance, allowing users to color stars by name and brightness.
- **Interactive Interface:** Engage with the star map to explore celestial data interactively.

## Applications

- **Astronomy Research:** A tool for analyzing and visualizing astronomical data.
- **Educational Resource:** Aids in learning about astronomy concepts and the Gaia dataset.
- **Data Analysis:** Facilitates the interpretation of complex astronomical data.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Displays graphical representations for better understanding.
- **Public Outreach:** Engages the public in astronomy and exoplanet research.
